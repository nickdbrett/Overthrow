        <p>Overthrow is a real time strategy game where you command the police and suppress the people in a city on the brink of revolution. Your police officers must control crowds of reactive, intelligent physically simulated people as they revolt against their leaders. The police can form cordons to guide the movement of people, stop opposing crowds from mixing or kettle protesters. The people react to police actions, running in fear or retaliating against violence. Behaviours can spread through groups of like minded people so a single act of police brutality can quickly turn an angry but peaceful protest into a full blown riot. You must keep the peace with limited resources which may mean resorting to heavy handed tactics. Arrest individuals or resort to tear gas and pepper spray to deter more determined dissidents. You must prop up the corrupt government or somehow manage the collapse of social order.</p>
