    <section class="main-content">
      <p>Overthrow is a real time strategy game where you command the police and suppress the people in a city on the brink of revolution. Control crowds, put down protests and crush riots. Form cordons of police officers to physically constrain  the movement of large crowds. Arrest individuals or resort to tear gas and pepper spray to deter more determined dissidents. You must prop up the corrupt government or manage the collapse of social order.</p>

<p>The game is set in a procedurally generated city populated with physically simulated people. The player has direct control over police officers and vehicles and must use them to manipulate much larger numbers of people. The police can form cordons to guide the the movement of people, stop opposing crowds from mixing or kettle protesters. Some officers carry tear gas or pepper spray. People react to police actions, running in fear or retaliating against violent police action. Behaviours can quickly spread through groups of like minded people so a single act of police brutality can quickly turn an angry protest into a full blown riot. The player must keep the peace with limited resources which may mean resorting to heavy handed tactics.</p>
